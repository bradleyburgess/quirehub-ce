# QuireHub

**QuireHub** is an all-in-one platform for managing choirs. It’s designed to
simplify and centralize the administrative and musical workflows that come with
running a choir — whether you're managing a church choir, school, or community,
or a professional group.

This is the **Community Edition**, which is self-hostable and open-source under
the **AGPLv3** license. ([See below for more.](#-open-core-model))

> ⚠️ **Status**: Early-stage development — core features are being actively built.
